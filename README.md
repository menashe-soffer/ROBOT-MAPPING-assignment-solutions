# ROBOT-MAPPING-assignment-solutions
solutions to the assignments in http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws13/mapping/

In this repository I will commit my solutions to the assignments in the course, which is publically available in the link above.

Cyrill Stachniss is a great tutor; he is very methodological, I engoy listening to his lectures.

The course material is still relevant today, however to couse now dates back 100 years; the assignments are in Octave. They are Octave code with some parts missing, which the student is supposed to fill in. today, however, python is more common, so I will translate everything to python. At this stage i will only deposite complete code; maybe in the future I will compile another version with the parts missing to be filled in.
