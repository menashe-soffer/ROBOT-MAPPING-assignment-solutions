Here is the python code for assignment 7.
in this assignment we have known robot poses, and laser readings for exch of the 686 poses. the task is to map the environmnet.
This is relatively easy assignmnet.

I did not use Bresenham's algorithm for the trajectories; made a naive masks instead. The python code is faster than the octave.
