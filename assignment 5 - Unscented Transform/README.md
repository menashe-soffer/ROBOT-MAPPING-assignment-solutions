Assignmnet 5 is a short and simple one, not realy SLAM task, just small excersize in ascented transform.

In contrast to the original task "framework" that runs each transform at a time (and one is supposed to select the transform by uncommenting the others), here I made a loop over the 3.

I also uploaded the single plot that is generated.
